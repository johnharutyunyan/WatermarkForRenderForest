# Watermark on Video

Adding a Watermark Layer in Playback: Adjusting for video orientation (portrait or landscape) to correctly place the watermark.
Video Export Issues: Transforming portrait videos that were automatically saved as landscape, ensuring correct export functionality.
Module Implementation:
ViewModel Module: Contains the logic for the user interface.
Core Module: Hosts my services, forming the backbone of the application.
Shared Module: Features a beautifully crafted console logger. This logger is type-safe and provides insightful logging throughout the codebase.
Utilization of Swinject: 
For dependency injection, I have employed Swinject, which has streamlined the process of managing dependencies within the app.
Demo App Features:
First Screen: Allows users to set the rotation count and select a video.
Second Screen: Offers watermark selection, play/pause, and seek functionalities with a moving watermark demonstration.
Export Functionality: Includes an export button that saves videos in mp4 format, with potential adaptation for .mov format.
